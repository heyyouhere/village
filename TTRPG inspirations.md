As main inspiration Disco Ellysium getting everything from TTRPG, so should we.

It's been a while scince i played some, but lets get started somewhere.
# D&D
To brutal and to specific for our purpuses. Roll d20 and get modifier never seemed fun to me, as it is most basic check you can imagine.
# \*W
I dont ever played this system enougth to get a good look at it, however, i like the normal curve of 2d6 and negative attrubuites. It is easy to understand and to teach about.
6- critical lose
7-11 - succsess
12+ - extra succsess

I think we can find something intresting in Blue Beard Wife and Blades in the Dark.

# Year Zero
I love, that skill level is a heath itself. This is simple, but ellagent dynamic.
Maybe simpler that year zero, in a sence, that we wont use skills, only attributes.

# d100
Generic system, that allmost all CRPG uses, people will be familiar, but it is hard to surprize anyone with it.

# Fate and FAE
I really like aspects and all this stuff, however, i dont see how it can be implemented in video game in such capacity.

# Savage world
Explosive dice -- yes, i love it.
Broken curve of distribution. 
Love wound system. It is simple, and ellagent.
